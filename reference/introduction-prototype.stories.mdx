# Mdh Design System âœ¨

This is the FED component for Mdh apps.

As a rule of thumb, we follow regular TypeScript and React conventions when we write components.

## (1) Development Flow
 
We have a design system first approach. Any FED component should be created in the design system first, and then imported as a module.
<br />
 
## (2) How to create a component
 
The current convention for creating a new component is described below.
<br />
 
### React Conventions ðŸ‘‘
<br />
 
#### 1. Basic Principles
 
- We try to minimise the bundle size for performance.
- We support IE11.
- Do not add margin when we create components.
- Keep the component less than 100 lines if possible. If it exceeds more than 150 lines, we need to think about refactoring it.
- Add change log, versions and follow the release process in README.md at the root of this repo.
 
#### 2. Props
 
- Props for a component should be Type, not interface because our component should be expandable and export the type as well as the component.
However, use interfaces if there is any case that is suitable.
```typescript
export type MyProps = {
 hidden: boolean,
 content: text
}
```
 
- To limit style customisation, add
```typescript
OmitClassName<InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>>
```
 
- Add ...props so that we can extend the html element. Our custom props should be only used for styling purposes.
```typescript
export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentPorps> = ({ firstProp, secondProp, ...props }) => { ... }
```
 
- Use string Enum to limit the prop options.
 
- Enums should live in the same folder as the component. Create a file called enums.ts as below.
```bash
ComponentExample # component folder
 enums.ts # this is the enum file
 ...
 ComponentExample.tsx
 ...
```
 
- Props should be destructured and add default value for the props that need default value. We should not have default value for unrequired props.
 
- Use React.FC to type props so that children can come without explicitly adding it.
```typescript
export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentPorps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
```
 
#### 3. Exporting components
 
- We do not use export default. Instead, export the component itself.
```typescript
// good
export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentPorps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
 
// not good
const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentPorps> = ({ ... }) => { ... }
export default MyComponent;
```
 
- Create index.tsx file and export all the components within the same folder.
- We need to export the component so that it is usable from the same entry point.
- For subcomponents, we export them with dot notation (see example Slider).
 
#### 4. Approach to Style
 
- We use CSS modules.
- Use utility joinClassNames when we have conditional class names.
```typescript
const classes = joinClassNames(
 styles.button,
 styles[size],
 fullWidth && styles.fullWidth,
);
```
- Create styles.scss file in the same folder and import it in the component.
```typescript
import styles from './styles.scss';
...
```
 
#### 5. Accessibility
 
- Every input element has a label for accessibility. Make sure to add hidden true or false.
 
#### 6. Syntax preference
 
- Use empty tag (`<>`) instead of `<React.Fragment>`.
 
#### 7. Tools
 
- Keep the React version the same as the main source code.
- We would like to minimise the use of 3rd party libraries (e.g. do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, lodash and so on).
- Use yarn.
 
#### 8. Polyfills
 
- We need to be explicit about which polyfills to be used if it is necessary.
- Import it in the entry file.
 
#### 9. Naming convention
 
- camelCase for variables.
- PascalCase for component names and enums.
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constant name.
 
<br />
 
### SCSS Conventions ðŸ’„
 
#### 1. Syntax
 
- camelCase for className. This is because it makes it easier to use the dot notation (e.g. styel.myClassName).
- To extend class name, use double underscore (e.g. &__supersize)
 
#### 2. Coding guide
 
- Do not hard code any value. Use variables.
 
```scss
$loader-width: 60px;
 
.div {
 width: $loder-width
}
```
 
- Do not repeat the properties. Use mixins. Example below is when we use transform to add wider browser support.
 
```scss
@mixin transformCrossBrowsers($property) {
 -webkit-transform: $property;
 -ms-transform: $property;
 transform: $property;
}
 
.div {
  @include transformCrossBrowsers(rotateY(0deg));
}
```
 
### Storybook Conventions ðŸ“–
 
We are using Storybook v7. Many changes happen in v6.
Some of the old APIs have been deprecated.
As a rule of thumb, we use the convention recommended for v6 and above.
 
#### 1. General rules
 
- We prefer not to use outdated APIs like StoryOf.
- We use mdx for stories.
 
#### 2. Folder structure
 
- Here is our folder structure.
 
```bash
.github/workflows # This is where github action script lives
 
.storybook # storybook configuration folder
 estimateOneTheme.js # Custom storybook theme for EstimateOne
 main.js # Main config - if you need to add addons, this is the file you need to update
 manager-head.html # Inject elements globally. This is where titles and favicons are.
 manager.js # Setting custom config
 preview-head.html # Inject head to preview page
 preview.js # Anything that affects globally for Canvas and Docs goes here.
